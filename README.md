# Jigsaw Security Enterprise JSync

![alt tag](https://ui.slcsecurity.com/img/custom/JSLOGO.png)

The JSync scripts are used to process data received or sent from Jigsaw Security enterprise data store. These are sample scripts and utilities provided by Jigsaw or our customers. Some scripts require Apache NiFi or Safemove2 to operate correctly. Some of these scripts are general use and may be useful for other projects  <P></P>
You must have a valid API key to use the scripts for pulling data from Jigsaw Enterprise MISP instance. For Hadoop based scripts you must have a Hadoop account on the Jigsaw Cluster. For more information email the Jigsaw Security SOC for assistance.
